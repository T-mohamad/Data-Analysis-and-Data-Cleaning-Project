# Data Analysis and Data Cleaning Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates essential **data cleaning** and **data analysis** techniques using Python and popular libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib**.  
The goal is to transform raw, messy data into clean datasets and extract meaningful insights for decision-making.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **pandas** – data manipulation and cleaning
- **numpy** – numerical operations
- **matplotlib / seaborn** – visualization
- **scikit-learn** – optional, for preprocessing and modeling

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Drop or impute missing data using mean/median/mode.
2. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identify and remove duplicate rows.
3. **Data Type Conversion**
   - Ensure columns have correct data types (e.g., dates, integers).
4. **Outlier Detection**
   - Use statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) to detect and handle outliers.
5. **Standardization & Normalization**
   - Scale numerical features for consistency.
6. **String Cleaning**
   - Trim spaces, fix casing, remove special characters.

## 📊 Data Analysis Steps
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, std).
   - Distribution plots and histograms.
2. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.
3. **Trend Analysis**
   - Time-series plots for temporal data.
4. **Segmentation**
   - Grouping data by categories for deeper insights.
5. **Visualization**
   - Bar charts, scatter plots, box plots to communicate findings.
## 🧰 Data Cleaning Tools

While Python is powerful for automation and reproducibility, many organizations also rely on **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau** for data cleaning and preparation. This project highlights how these tools can be used:

### 🔹 Microsoft Excel
- **Remove Duplicates**: Quickly identify and delete duplicate rows.
- **Text Functions**: Clean strings using TRIM, PROPER, and SUBSTITUTE.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure consistent input values.
- **Power Query**: Automate cleaning steps like merging, filtering, and transforming datasets.

### 🔹 Power BI
- **Power Query Editor**: Handle missing values, split/merge columns, and transform data types.
- **Data Modeling**: Create relationships between tables for cleaner analysis.
- **Calculated Columns & Measures**: Standardize metrics and apply business rules.
- **Automated Refresh**: Keep cleaned datasets updated with scheduled refreshes.

### 🔹 Tableau
- **Data Interpreter**: Automatically detect headers, sub-tables, and clean raw Excel/CSV files.
- **Calculated Fields**: Standardize and transform values directly in Tableau.
- **Data Blending**: Combine multiple sources while ensuring consistency.
- **Prep Builder**: Visual interface for cleaning, joining, and reshaping data before analysis.

---

## 📌 Why Use These Tools?
- **Excel**: Best for quick, small-scale cleaning tasks and widely used in business.
- **Power BI**: Ideal for enterprise-level reporting with automated cleaning pipelines.
- **Tableau**: Great for visual-first workflows where cleaning and analysis are integrated.

Together, these tools complement Python workflows, offering flexibility depending on project size, team skills, and business needs.
